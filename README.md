# Portfolio

Source code for my personal website; this is a new version written
in Clojure and Luminus. The [old one][portfolio-old] was written in Haskell.

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein run

## What was used?

### Server

I use [luminus][luminus] framework with the default web stack (Compojure and Ring).

### CSS

[Garden][garden] as a CSS pre-processor replacement.

### Javascript

[ClojureScript][clojurescript] as Javascript replacement, this allows code sharing between the client and the server.
